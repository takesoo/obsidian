Hi, Jason. 
Hey Poal, it's so good <span style="color:#c00000">to</span> see you again.
Great see you too ~~soon~~, Jason. Did you have a good spring break?
Yeah, it wasn't too bad. おざー my mom work もーめんとそー. 
<span style="color:#c00000">Althogh my mom had to work a lot of it, so...</span>
I was in looking after my little brother Jimy.
<span style="color:#c00000">I was in charge of looking after my little brother Jimmy.</span>
Oh no.
Well he is a very cool kid~~.~~ <span style="color:#c00000">and</span> great company. He's like a ~~めにーみー~~ <span style="color:#c00000">mini-me</span>. I took him ~~a~~ <span style="color:#c00000">to the</span> skate park ~~with a lot of~~ <span style="color:#c00000">and some other</span> atractions.
~~That's awesome right.~~ <span style="color:#c00000">That sounds alright.</span> I might ~~みーとーざみーとどぅーさむぽいんと~~ <span style="color:#c00000">need to meet the little dude at some point</span>. 
He helps to remember びー kids and store fun.
<span style="color:#c00000">He helps me remember to be a kid and still have fun.</span>
Nice! 
What about you?  ~~What ぢゅーげだっぷ to you?~~ <span style="color:#c00000">What did you get up to?</span>
We went to visit my ~~あーんとう~~ <span style="color:#c00000">Aunt and</span> ~~my~~ Uncle. They live~~s~~ ~~in~~ <span style="color:#c00000">on</span> the other side of <span style="color:#c00000">the</span> country.
Realy? Was it good? Did you ~~get~~ <span style="color:#c00000">have</span> ~~a~~ fun?
Yeah. ~~Realy~~ <span style="color:#c00000">we had a</span> great time. They live right next to <span style="color:#c00000">a</span> forest, and me and my cousins ~~らいふりーこーぜ~~ <span style="color:#c00000">roamed free all day</span>. We made ~~えんしょーえんどりんきん~~ <span style="color:#c00000">dens to shelter when the rain came</span>, tracked animals ~~to~~ <span style="color:#c00000">through the</span> bush ~~さっでぃえねんさーばー~~ <span style="color:#c00000">and saw a deer and rabbits</span>, and went canoeing on the river. My uncle ~~told~~ <span style="color:#c00000">taught</span> me how to use the paddles ~~scriping~~ <span style="color:#c00000">correctly</span>, and (はどーすくらぴんとぅーだ) <span style="color:#c00000">how to steer the canoe through the</span> water.
Wow, you had so many amazing experiences.
Yes I did. And ~~did~~ <span style="color:#c00000">there's</span> more. They also have a big farm ~~and~~ <span style="color:#c00000">with</span> so many animals. (えとぅっくけあとぅどぅ) <span style="color:#c00000">I took care of them too</span>. 
Were there any horses at the farm?
Yes, there were many beautiful horses.
Wow, how cool. Did you ride the horse?
Yes I did. It was fantastic.
I've never ~~ride~~ <span style="color:#c00000">ridden</span> a horse.
Well, next time, I'll see ~~you ぶしーむ~~ <span style="color:#c00000">if you can </span> come too. I can show you how (かんとりーふぉーくりむ) <span style="color:#c00000">country folk live</span>.
Yeah, that would be awesome.
